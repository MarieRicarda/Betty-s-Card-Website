# Betty-s-Card-Website

My goal is to become a front-end web developer so this project is one of the many I am currently working on. My aunt makes and sells hand painted greeting cards and she wanted me to make a website for her budding business. I used a w3.css template from w3Schools. I like using these templates because the website design is simple and sleek and they have a large verity to choose from. I started learning Bootstrap but I think w3.css is easier to learn. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know!
